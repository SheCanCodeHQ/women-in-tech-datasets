# women-in-tech-datasets
Two-fold project. 1) Collect women in tech data for reporting and accountability work. 2) Provide an interesting dataset for teaching women about data. Hosting for this project is sponsored by [Neurensic](http://www.neurensic.com/).

## Reasoning (Why?)

### Reporting and Accountability

People talk about the lack of women in tech but tend to avoid the data, measurement, and SMART goals needed to make a huge change. By collating data about the problem in one place we make it easier to hold individuals accountable for the action(s) and/or in-action(s).

### Data Teaching Tool

While there are plenty of public datasets available for experimentation, research, and teaching, there are some additional barriers to being able to use them. They can include:

* They are in files, not a SQL database.
* They may contain errors in either formatting or data.
* There may be no documentation or explanation of meanings.
* They probably aren't that immediately and directly interesting or relevant to beginning data learners.

## Activities (What?)

1. Collect the data

2. ETL the data into cloud-based SQL storage (postgreSQL)

3. Document the data

4. Make credentials to the postgreSQL database available to women for research and learning purposes. 

## (How?)

[@alison985](https://www.github.com/alison985), a [@chiladieshack](https://www.github.com/chiladieshack) project team on April 1-2, 2016, and future contributors this project will be developed and iterated on.

## About (Who?)

[@alison985](https://github.com/alison985) started this project both because of her data background, because she couldn't find this information, and because she's tired about only talking about the problem and the conventional wisdom solutions. Calling on her queer activist background and deep data expertise, this project was born. Alison happens to work at this cool place [Neurensic](http://www.neurensic.com/) where is the Data Engineering Manager. As part of Neurensic's intentionally inclusive recruiting practices, they are sponsoring the SQL hosting for this project.
