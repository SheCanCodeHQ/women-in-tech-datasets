<p>2002-2003 Taulbee Survey </p>
<p>Undergraduate Enrollments Drop; Department Growth Expectations
Moderate </p>
</font>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
<p><b>By Stuart Zweben and William Aspray </b></p>
<p>This article and the accompanying figures and tables present the
results of the 33rd annual CRA Taulbee Survey1 of Ph.D.-granting
departments of computer science (CS) and computer engineering (CE) in
the United States and Canada. This survey is conducted annually by the
Computing Research Association to document trends in student
enrollment, employment of graduates, and faculty salaries. </p>
<p>Information was gathered during the fall of 2003. Responses received
by December 10, 2003 are included in the analysis. The periods the data
cover vary from table to table. Degree production (Ph.D., Master's, and
Bachelor's) and total Bachelor's, Master's and Ph.D. enrollments refer
to the previous academic year (2002-2003). Data for new students in all
categories refer to the current academic year (2003-2004). Projected
student production and information on faculty salaries and demographics
also refer to the current academic year. Faculty salaries are those
effective January 1, 2004. </p>
<p>The data were collected from Ph.D.-granting departments only. A
total of 225 departments were surveyed, the same number as last year.
As shown in Figure 1, 177 departments returned their survey forms, for
a response rate of 79 percent (compared to 80 percent last year). The
return rate of 7 out of 29 (24%) for Computer Engineering (CE) programs
is very low, as has been the case for several years (see below). We
attribute this low response to two factors: 1) many CE programs are
part of an ECE department, and they do not keep separate statistics for
CE vs. EE; and 2) many of these departments are not aware of the
Taulbee Survey or its importance. The response rate for US CS
departments (151 of 169, or 89%) was very good, while the 70% response
rate for Canadian programs was moderately good although not as good as
in the past several years. </p>
<p><img src="taulbe1.gif" border="0"></p>
<p>The set of departments responding varies slightly from year to year,
even when the total numbers are about the same; thus, we must approach
any trend analysis with caution. We must be especially cautious in
using the data about CE departments because of the low response rate.
However, we have reported CE departments separately because there are
some significant differences between CS and CE departments. </p>
<p>The survey form itself is modified slightly each year to ensure a
high rate of return (e.g., by simplifying and clarifying), while
continuing to capture the data necessary to understand trends in the
discipline and also reflect changing concerns of the computing research
community. This year, preliminary survey results about faculty salaries
were reported in December 2003 only to respondents. The CRA Board views
this, and the release of this final report to respondents in early
March 2004, as benefits of participation in the survey. We intend to
continue this practice in future years. </p>
<p>This year we also included several new questions from the former
Departmental Profiles Survey (see the section entitled
&ldquo;Additional Departmental Profiles Analysis&rdquo;). We are
especially pleased that the increased size of this year&rsquo;s survey
did not have a detrimental effect on the response rate. We thank all
respondents who completed this year's questionnaire. Departments that
participated are listed at the end of this article. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="1">Ph.D.</a> Degree Production and Enrollments</b> (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables1to8.html">Tables 1-8</a>)
</p>
<p>As shown in <a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables1to8.html">Table 1</a>,
a total of 877 Ph.D. degrees were awarded in 2003 by the 177 responding
departments. This is an increase of 3% over last year, but still
represents, as Figure 2 indicates, the second lowest total national
Ph.D. production since 1989. Most likely this number is still
reflecting the high-tech boom of the late 1990s when start-up companies
presented an extremely attractive employment option for computer
scientists. </p>
<p><img src="taulbe3.gif" border="0"></p>
<p>The prediction from last year's survey that 1,224 Ph.D. degrees
would be awarded in 2003 was, as usual, overly optimistic, with an
"optimism" ratio, defined as the actual over the predicted, being 0.72.
Given next year's prediction of 1,350 graduates (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables1to8.html">Table 1</a>),
we believe the actual number will be between 900 and 1,000. </p>
<p>Most of the other numbers indicate that doctoral students are
staying in school and progressing towards the degree. The number
entering Ph.D. programs (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables1to8.html">Table 5</a>)
decreased from 3,286 to 3,131 (5%), with this decrease entirely
attributable to Canadian and CE respondents. The US CS numbers are
flat. However, the number who passed qualifiers (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables1to8.html">Table 1</a>)
increased from 1,375 to 1,545 (12%). On a per-department basis, the
number passing qualifiers has risen from 6.5 to 8.7 (33%) in three
years. The number who passed thesis proposal exams (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables1to8.html">Table 1</a>)
stayed almost flat, changing from 884 to 881. Total Ph.D. enrollment
(Table 6) increased from 10,021 to 12,007 (20%). It seems that the slow
turn-around of the economy, and of the dot-com economy in particular,
has attracted more people to graduate school in recent years, and more
of them appear to be moving past at least the qualifier stage of the
Ph.D. program. </p>
<p>Figure 3 shows a longer-term trend of the number of CS Ph.D.
graduates, normalized by the number of departments responding to the
Taulbee Survey. This graph also shows the number of new students
entering Ph.D. programs and the number of students who passed
qualifiers. These also are normalized for the number of departments
reporting. The graph offsets the qualifier data by one year from the
data for new students, and offsets the graduation data by five years
from the data for new students, to approximate the lag between student
entrance into the pipeline, and the qualifier and exit time frame for
the same cohort. The figure suggests that, unless a larger fraction of
those passing qualifiers do not complete the program, significant
increases in Ph.D. production are only a few years away.</p>
<p><img src="taulbe2.gif" border="0"></p>
<p><a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables1to8.html">Table
4</a> shows employment for new Ph.D. recipients. Of those who reported
employment domestically, 63% took academic employment (compared to 53%
last year and 43% the year before). Most of these academic positions
were in Ph.D.-granting departments, but 31 were in other CS/CE
departments. This represents a considerable increase from the 9
reported last year as having gone to non-Ph.D.-granting CS/CE
departments, but still likely falls considerably short of meeting the
needs of those departments. There has also been a slight increase (from
83 to 89) in the number of postdoctoral positions (up from 56 two years
ago). Figure 4 shows the trend of employment of new Ph.D.s to academia
and industry, and the proportion of those going to academia who took
positions other than in Ph.D-granting CS/CE departments. After many
years of a decided preference for industry jobs over academic jobs, the
trend during the most recent two years is striking, and indicative of
economic conditions in industry. This has been good for Ph.D-granting
CS/CE departments.</p>
<p><img src="taulbe4.gif" border="0"></p>
<p><a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables1to8.html">Table
4</a> also indicates increases in the proportion of new CS/CE Ph.D.s in
the programming languages/compilers, OS/networks, software engineering,
and graphics/HCI areas, while the AI/robotics, theory/algorithms, and
database/information systems areas experienced a decreased proportion
of Ph.D.s. Multi-year trends are less clear, though there appears to
have been an increased production in the graphics/HCI and the
numerical/scientific computing areas during the past five years. </p>
<p>Most statistics on gender and ethnicity for Ph.D. students (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables1to8.html">Tables 2,
3, 7, 8</a>) show little change from last year or, indeed, the last
several years. White and nonresident-alien men continue to account for
a very large fraction of our Ph.D. production and enrollments. Women
represented 20% of enrollments, 17% of graduates. All other
underrepresented groups make up a very small minority. As Figure 5
illustrates, we see a second year of slight decrease in the proportion
of enrolled Ph.D. students who are nonresident aliens. The cause of
this trend is unclear. It could be an increased interest in Ph.D.
programs by domestic students, difficulties with visas for foreign
students, or a perceived hostile environment that makes the United
States seem less attractive to foreign students. Even with this
two-year decline, the current proportion of non-resident aliens is the
third highest in the past ten years. However, in 2003, the Educational
Testing Service reports significant decreases in the number of students
taking the GRE exam from countries that historically have been large
feeders of North American graduate programs in CS/CE (especially China
and India). The effect of this phenomenon on next year&rsquo;s Taulbee
data bears watching.</p>
<p><img src="taulbe5.gif" border="0"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="2">Master's</a> and Bachelor's Degree Production and
Enrollments</b> (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables9to16.html">Tables
9-16</a>) </p>
<p>The statistics on Master's and Bachelor's degrees awarded show mixed
trends. Master's degrees were awarded to 9,141 students, an increase of
15% (following a decrease of 4 percent the year before). This may be a
byproduct of the increased enrollment trends in Ph.D. programs, since
in many schools students obtain the M.S. on the way to the Ph.D. Actual
Master&rsquo;s degrees awarded exceeded last year&rsquo;s projections
by 17%. This year's expected Master's production (Table 12) exceeds the
projection from last year's survey by 4 percent, but if met this still
would represent a decrease of more than a 10% from last year&rsquo;s
actual production. Bachelor's degrees numbered 19,990, a decrease of 3%
(following an increase of 21 percent the year before). Most of this
decrease came from CE programs; CS production was down less than 2%,
perhaps reflecting the residuals of the high growth in undergraduate
program enrollment of the late 1990s. Actual Bachelor&rsquo;s
production was only about 1% less than projected last year. Projected
Bachelor's production for this year shows a decrease from last
year&rsquo;s projections of 7 percent (see Figure 6). </p>
<p><img src="taulbe6.gif" border="0"></p>
<p>As shown in Figure 7, the number of new undergraduate majors dropped
significantly from 23,033 to 17,706 (23%). For the previous three
years, the number of new undergraduate students was approximately
constant, whereas during the five years before that the number of new
undergraduate students more than doubled. One major reason for this
striking new trend is that the decline in the technology industry and
the moving of jobs offshore are making computer science and engineering
less alluring to new undergraduates. In addition, some programs have
restricted admission to a subset of those desiring the computer science
and engineering major, either by setting numerical limits or increasing
the standards for admission. The selectivity of these programs has an
impact on the number of students who want to compete for positions in
these programs. Lastly, the introduction of new undergraduate programs
in the IT field has created alternatives to the traditional CS and CE
majors, possibly siphoning students who previously would have selected
CS/CE programs. In any case, it is quite clear that the period of
explosive growth in enrollments in Bachelor's programs is over.</p>
<p><img src="taulbe7.gif" border="0"></p>
<p>In all other numbers, we again see mixed trends in both Bachelor's
and Master's programs. New Master's students (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables9to16.html">Table 13</a>)
decreased by 8% after having decreased by 3% the previous year. This is
further evidence of the effect of the dot-com crash, as fewer students
seek degree programs designed mainly to prepare them for industry
employment. Total enrollments in Bachelor's programs (Table 16) dropped
by 19% (having increased in US CS departments by 4% to 5% and overall
by 11% the previous year) and enrollments in Master's programs (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables9to16.html">Table 15</a>)
dropped by 4% (having increased by 21% the previous year). </p>
<p>Most demographics regarding gender and ethnicity for Bachelor's and
Master's students show stability when compared with last year's
results. The proportion of Master's degree recipients who are
nonresident aliens (55.8%) is about the same as the previous year (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables9to16.html">Table 10</a>).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="3">Faculty</a> Demographics</b> (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables17to23.html">Tables
17-23</a>) </p>
<p>Over the past year, the total number of faculty increased by 6
percent to a total of 5,831. Increases were shown in every category:
tenure-track, researcher, postdoc, and teaching faculty. </p>
<p>Ph.D. production shows only 434 graduates taking faculty positions
at CS/CE Ph.D-granting departments (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables1to8.html">Table 4</a>).
<a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables17to23.html">Tables
19 and 20</a> indicate that a total of 607 persons were hired during
the past year. Thus, more than 70% of the faculty hires appear to have
been new Ph.D.s, with the rest a combination of faculty who changed
academic position, persons joining academia from government and
industry, new Ph.D.s from disciplines outside of CS/CE, and non-Ph.D.
holders (e.g., taking a teaching faculty appointment). </p>
<p>This year's observed faculty growth to 5,831 was very close to the
prediction of 5,881 from last year's survey. Planned growth for this
year is only 2% and only 5% for the following year. Departmental
expectations appear to be much more modest and realistic than in
previous years. This may reflect more firm numbers of open positions
than in the days when several departments were reported to have an
open-ended number of positions, and also may reflect an increased
supply of candidates. </p>
<p><a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables17to23.html">Table
23</a> on faculty "losses" shows that the same number of people (89,
which is less than 2% of all faculty) actually left academia through
death, retirement, or taking nonacademic positions this year and last
year. However, this year, the amount of &ldquo;churn,&rdquo; the number
of professors moving from one academic position to another, decreased
from 108 to 74. Thus we have further evidence that the faculty
"retention problem" that was so much discussed over the past few years
seems to have solved itself. </p>
<p>The demographic data for faculty (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables17to23.html">Tables
19-22</a>) show very small changes. Overall, the percentage of newly
hired women faculty increased from 18% to 19%. The gender split of new
faculty (81% male, 19% female) remains close to the split for new Ph.D.
recipients (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables1to8.html">Table 2</a>).
While there are more newly hired men in tenure-track (82%) and research
(86%) positions, these categories are slightly less male-dominated than
they were the year before. The percentage of newly hired teaching
faculty who are women dropped from 26% to 22%. These changes had no
marked effect on the percentages of current faculty of each gender. </p>
<p>It is interesting to compare the ethnicity data for new faculty (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables17to23.html">Table 20</a>)
with that of Ph.D. recipients (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables1to8.html">Table 3</a>).
Forty-nine percent of the newly hired tenure-track faculty in
Ph.D.-granting departments and 72% of the newly hired teaching faculty
are white, non-Hispanic, even though only 37 percent of the Ph.D.
recipients are in this category. By contrast, only 23 percent of the
new faculty are nonresident aliens, whereas 43 percent of the degree
recipients are in that category. Some new faculty could have become
residents after receiving their Ph.D. degrees, but it seems clear that
proportionately fewer foreign students take positions, especially
teaching positions, at universities in North America. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="4">Research</a> Expenditures and Graduate Student Support</b>
(<a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables24to26.html">Tables
24-26</a>) </p>
<p><a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables24to26.html">Table
24</a> shows the department's total expenditure (including indirect
costs or "overhead" as stated on project budgets) from external sources
of support. As was true last year, the higher the ranking, the more
external funding per capita, where capitation is computed relative to
the number of tenured and tenure-track faculty members. Canadian levels
are shown in Canadian dollars. The median per capita amount of support
for schools in the 1-36 bands compared to the median reported in last
year&rsquo;s survey grew in the 5% to 10% range, while in the lower
ranks, the median actually dropped by 3%. Canadian departments show a
lower level of expenditures from external sources than every US ranking
band; this stems, no doubt, from differences in the way that research
is funded in Canada. It is difficult to draw meaning for the numbers
for computer engineering because of the small number of departments
reporting. </p>
<p><a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables24to26.html">Table
25</a> shows the number of graduate students supported as full-time
students as of fall 2003, further categorized as teaching assistants,
research assistants, fellows, or computer systems supporters, and split
between those on institutional vs. external funds. The higher the
ranking of the department, the greater the proportion of graduate
students who are supported on external funds (typically as research
assistants and fully supported, externally funded fellows). Canadian
departments are more likely than US departments to support their
graduate students through teaching assistantships rather than research
assistantships. </p>
<p>Respondents were asked to "provide the net amount (as of fall 2003)
of an academic-year stipend for a graduate student (not including
tuition or fees)." The results are shown in <a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables24to26.html">Table 26</a>.
Canadian stipends are shown in Canadian dollars. The higher the ranking
band, the higher the median level of support for teaching assistants.
Median amounts of support for research assistants at the top 24 schools
also are much higher than those for the lower-ranked bands.</p>

 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables27to34.html">Tables
27-34</a>) </p>
<p>Each department was asked to report the minimum, median, mean, and
maximum salaries for each rank (full, associate, and assistant
professors and non-tenure-track teaching faculty) and the number of
persons at each rank. The salaries are those in effect on January 1,
2004. For US departments, nine-month salaries are reported in US
dollars. For Canadian departments, twelve-month salaries are reported
in Canadian dollars. Respondents were asked to include salary
supplements such as salary monies from endowed positions. </p>
<p>The minimum and maximum of the reported salary minima (and maxima)
are self-explanatory. The range of salaries in a given rank among
departments that reported data for that rank is the interval ["minimum
of the minima," "maximum of the maxima"]. The mean of the reported
salary minima (maxima) in a given rank is computed by summing the
departmental reported minimum (maximum) and dividing by the number of
departments reporting data at that rank. </p>
<p>The median salary at each rank is the middle of the list if you
order its members&rsquo; mean salaries at that rank from lowest to
highest, or the average of the middle two numbers if there is an even
number of items in the set. The average salary at each rank is computed
by summing the individual means reported at each rank and dividing by
the number of departments reporting at that rank. We recognize that
these means and medians are only approximations to the true means and
medians for their rank. </p>
<p>U.S. average salaries increased between 1.9% and 2.5%, depending on
tenure-track rank, and 1.4% for non-tenure teaching faculty. These
increases are less than the 3% levels experienced last year. Canadian
salaries (shown as 12-month salaries in Canadian dollars) decreased by
0.8% to 2.0%, depending on rank. This compares unfavorably to last
year&rsquo;s increase of 3.8% to 5.2% for different tenure-track
categories; it may also reflect differences in the specific departments
reporting, which has a more profound effect on Canadian results than on
US results. </p>
<p>Median salaries for new Ph.D.s (those who received their Ph.D. last
year and then joined departments as tenure-track faculty) were
unchanged from those reported in last year&rsquo;s survey (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables27to34.html">Table 34</a>).
This may help ease the salary compression and inversion experienced
during the dot-com boom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Additional Departmental Profiles Analysis </b></p>
<p>Every three years, CRA collects additional information about various
aspects of departmental activities that are not expected to change much
over a one-year period. These data used to be collected via a separate
survey, called the Departmental Profiles Survey. The most recent data
from this survey were published in the November 2000 issue of Computing
Research News. Effective this year, the data from this survey will be
collected as part of the Taulbee data collection cycle during those
years when these data are due to be collected (next in fall of 2006).
The data include teaching loads, sources of external funding, methods
of recruiting graduate students, departmental support staff, and space.
Where possible, we will compare this year&rsquo;s results with the
previous Profiles report. However, there is a much higher response rate
from US CS departments to this year&rsquo;s survey, particularly among
higher-ranked departments, so comparisons with the previous survey
should be interpreted with this in mind.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="6">Teaching</a> Loads</b> (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables35to38.html">Tables
35-38</a>) </p>
<p><a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables35to38.html">Tables
35-38</a> discuss teaching loads in semester-length courses per year.
The US departments ranked 1-12 have the lowest teaching loads, both
officially and actually, with departments ranked 13-36 having slightly
higher loads and other CS departments and CE departments having the
highest loads. The Canadian departments have official loads that are
similar to those of the US departments ranked in the top 36, but they
seem to have less load reduction than the US departments so that their
official and actual loads are about the same. Mean actual teaching
loads in US CS departments ranked above 12 are slightly higher than
those in the previous Profiles survey conducted in 2000, while official
loads and median actual loads for these departments are about the same
as they were in 2000. The actual and official load in the top 12
departments appears to be slightly lower now than in 2000. </p>
<p>Virtually all departments offer some possibility for load reduction,
and the majority offer the possibility of load increase. Load
reductions are widely available as parts of special packages for new
faculty and for administrative duties (and universal among the CE
departments that responded). About one-third of the departments offer
reduction for type or size of class taught. Buy-out policies vary
widely, with the US 1-12 ranked and the Canadian departments least
willing to offer buyouts. The Canadian schools and the lower-ranked US
departments are much more willing to give teaching load reduction for
strong research involvement than the US schools ranked in the top 36.
Increases in teaching load are mainly for faculty who are shifting
their primary responsibilities to teaching. The responses from the US
CS departments to this year&rsquo;s questions about load reduction and
increase are similar to those published in the 2000 Profiles report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="7">Sources</a> of External Funding</b> (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables39to44.html">Tables
39-44</a>) </p>
<p><a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables39to44.html">Tables
39-44</a> discuss sources of external funding. In US CS departments,
NSF is the largest funder, consistent with the situation in 2000.
Typically, NSF&rsquo;s share now is twice or more as high as the next
largest funders, generally DARPA or other defense agencies. Only small
percentages of funding are received from NIH, DOE, state agencies,
other mission-oriented federal agencies, or private foundations.
Defense agencies such as ARO, AFOSR, and ONR provide a larger
proportion of current funding for top 12 departments than they did in
2000, while NSF and DARPA provide a smaller proportion. For other US CS
departments, NSF&rsquo;s share is larger and DARPA&rsquo;s is smaller
than in 2000. Industry provides a larger share of funding in the top 12
departments, but a smaller share in other departments. </p>
<p>Median funding for US CS departments from each major source follow
the ranking strata, with highest values for rank 1-12 departments, next
highest values for departments ranked 13-24, and so on. Similarly,
industrial funding makes up a much higher percentage of the funding in
the US CS departments ranked 1-12 than in any other departments. CE
departments tend to get slightly more funding from NSF than DARPA, and
they receive higher percentages of funding from state agencies and
industrial sources than most CS departments. Since only a small number
of CE departments responded to the survey, care should be exercised
when trying to generalize these observations to other CE departments.
NSERC and the provincial agencies provide three-quarters of the
Canadian support, with the next highest levels of support coming from
industrial sources and other mission-oriented federal agencies. Actual
funding amounts were not reported in the CRN article associated with
the 2000 Profiles Survey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="8">Graduate</a> Student Recruiting</b> (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables45to47.html">Tables
45-47</a>) </p>
<p>Earlier we presented the current status of graduate student stipends
(see <a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables24to26.html">Table
26</a>). We update these each year as part of the regular Taulbee
Survey. The Profiles Survey asks about factors that affect these
stipends, and this information is summarized in <a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables45to47.html">Table 45</a>.
For most US departments, stipend amounts are most frequently affected
by advancement within the graduate program. Differences among the
stipend source are important at many US CS departments, with years of
service and recruiting enhancements being other factors in about a
quarter of the departments. It is noteworthy that recruiting
enhancements now are only a factor in about a quarter of the
departments rather than about a third in 2000, while the other factors
are present in the same proportion of departments as in 2000. In
Canada, the most important factor influencing stipend amounts is the
source of funds. </p>
<p><a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables45to47.html">Table
46</a> shows methods used by departments to recruit graduate students,
and <a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables45to47.html">Table
47</a> shows the costs associated with these methods. Most of the top
36 ranked departments use multi-year (typically 3 or 4 years) support
guarantees as a recruiting tool, whereas less than half of the CE
departments and departments ranked above 36 or unranked do so. The vast
majority of the top-ranked departments also pay for graduate students
to visit campus, which is much less common among the CE and other CS
departments. Top-ranked US CS departments are also much more likely to
enhance graduate student stipends than the other departments surveyed.
Overall, 45% of the US CS departments had stipend enhancements in the
2000 survey, so this appears to be a much less prevalent tool than it
was during the dot-com era. The typical enhancement is between $3,000
and $4,000 in the United States (about two-thirds the value for the
2000 survey) and $5,000 Canadian in Canada. The amount spent on paid
visits to campus appears comparable to the value in 2000, and the
amount of guaranteed summer support appears consistent with the general
stipend increases over the three-year period since the last Profiles
Survey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="9">Departmental</a> Support Staff</b> (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables48to50.html">Tables
48-50</a>) </p>
<p><a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables48to50.html">Tables
48-50</a> show various kinds of staff support provided to the
department. Table 48 shows that the higher the ranking, the more
full-time secretarial and administrative support the department has.
Schools ranked 1-12 have more than four times as much support as the
lower-ranked CS departments and 1.5 times as much support as a CE
department. It may be more useful to normalize these data by the size
of the department&rsquo;s tenure-track faculty. If this is done, the
top 12 departments and the CE departments have about 0.4 administrative
support staff per faculty, departments ranked 13-36 about 0.3, and
those ranked above 36 or unranked and the Canadian departments have
about 0.2. For the US CS departments, these normalized values are less
than they were in 2000. About 80% of funding for administrative support
staff comes from institutional funds in the top 24 departments, and 90%
or more comes from institutional funds in other departments. </p>
<p>The number of computer-support personnel employed by a CS department
(<a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables48to50.html">Table
49</a>) varies from a low of about 0.1 per tenure-track faculty for CE
departments and US CS departments ranked above 36 or unranked, to
slightly more than 0.2 per tenure-track faculty for US departments
ranked 1-12 and for Canadian departments. Top-ranked departments are
much more likely to support such positions with external funds (almost
half of computer support personnel in the top 12 departments are paid
from external funds, while only 10% to 20% of these personnel in
Canadian departments, CE departments, and US departments ranked above
24 are supported by external funds). </p>
<p><a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables48to50.html">Table
50</a> shows full-time research employees. US CE and Canadian CSE
departments typically employ with internal funds five or six times as
many full-time researchers as do US CS departments. US CS departments
ranked in the top 24 have many more such positions than do the other
departments, both in raw numbers and on a per FTE tenure-track faculty
basis; they are mainly supported with external funds. Except for the
top 12 departments, the ratios of research employees per FTE
tenure-track faculty in US CS departments have declined since 2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="10">Departmental</a> Space</b> (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables51to62.html">Tables
51-62</a>) </p>
<p><a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables51to62.html">Tables
51-62</a> illustrate a variety of space details. <a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables51to62.html">Table 51</a>
lists total current departmental space. The amount of space held by a
department varies widely, by a factor of almost 200 from smallest to
largest space. Within the US CS departments, the average department
ranked 1-12 has 1.5 times as much space per tenure-track faculty as the
typical other CS department. Average values per tenure-track faculty in
all US CS categories are below their corresponding values in the 2000
Profiles Survey, although in each stratum, actual average space has
grown at least 10%. The actual amount of additional space per
department increased about 5,000 sq. ft. from 2000 to 2003. In 2000,
departments estimated that they would receive over 30,000 sq. ft. of
new space by 2003. These differences may be explained by a combination
of optimism on the part of the departments, and the fact that much of
the new space ends up replacing existing space rather than adding to
it. Canadian departments average about 10% to 20% below typical US CS
departments. CE departments have the highest amount of space per FTE
faculty (about 56% above the level for rank 1-12 US CS departments). </p>
<p><a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables51to62.html">Tables
52-55</a> break down current space by category of space. The pattern in
<a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables51to62.html">Table
51</a> for total department space is similar in Table 52 (space for
faculty, staff, and student offices) and <a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables51to62.html">Table 53</a>
(space for conference and seminar rooms). <a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables51to62.html">Table 54</a>
shows that the CS departments ranked in the top 24 have substantially
more research laboratory space than the other CS departments. On a per
tenure-track faculty basis, the differences are not as great among the
US CS departments, but Canadian departments appear to have only
three-quarters the space per tenure-track faculty. CE departments have
about three times as much research lab space per tenure-track faculty
as do CS departments. Instructional lab space, shown in <a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables51to62.html">Table 55</a>,
is much greater for the top 12 ranked US CS departments and the
Canadian departments than for other departments responding. However,
several departments apparently do not have instructional lab space. In
those departments that space is probably owned by their college or
central campus offices, and in fact it is likely that many of the other
departments have at least some of their instructional space provided by
a more central university unit. </p>
<p>It is interesting to note that research lab space now is 27.7% of
the total space, whereas in 2000 it was only 21.0%. All other
categories of space are a somewhat smaller proportion of total space to
compensate for this. </p>
<p><a href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables51to62.html">Tables
56-62</a> show space growth expectations. <a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables51to62.html">Table 56</a>
indicates that only about half of the departments responding actually
have definite plans for new space. This contrasts with an 81% figure in
the 2000 survey. <a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables51to62.html">Table 57</a>
shows when the space is expected to be added, <a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables51to62.html">Table 58</a>
shows the total space expected, and <a
 href="/CRN/articles/may04/tables51to62.html">Tables
59-62</a> break down these expected additions by category of space.
Expected growth in office space accounts for the largest proportion
(41.5%) of the total expected space growth, but this is a smaller
proportion of office space than exists currently (50.9%). Each other
category of space accounts for about a 3% higher proportion of the
total planned space than it does as a proportion of current space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Concluding Observations </b></p>
<p>This year, we see more conclusive data supporting reductions in
undergraduate enrollments. This effect is observed in both the United
States and Canada. While the reductions are significant, they should be
interpreted in view of the staggering increases experienced in the late
1990s. Present enrollment levels are still considerably higher than
before the surge during the dot-com era. </p>
<p>An upturn in the number of Ph.D.s produced appears to be on the
horizon, absent exogenous forces. The multi-year increase in the number
of students who passed qualifiers should soon have an effect on the
number of graduates from Ph.D. programs. It will be interesting to see
if this trend continues as economic conditions improve. </p>
<p>Faculty churn appears to be over, at least for the time being. Far
fewer faculty moved from one academic position to another. Estimates of
faculty growth are considerably more modest, and more accurate, than in
previous years. Faculty salaries showed rather small increases compared
with the recent past. These observations all are consistent with the
economic downturn. </p>
<p>Some data from the former Departmental Profiles Survey showed
differences, but much of it did not. This validates CRA&rsquo;s
decision to conduct the Profiles analysis only every 3 years (next in
fall 2006). Of particular note is that high space growth is no longer
forecast, consistent with the softening of faculty growth. Also, fewer
departments appear to be offering special stipend enhancements as a
means to recruit new graduate students.</p>

<p>1. The title of the survey honors the late Orrin E. Taulbee of the
University of Pittsburgh, who conducted these surveys for the Computer
Science Board until 1984, with retrospective annual data going back to
1970. </p>
<p>2. Although the University of Pennsylvania and the University of
Chicago were tied in the National Research Council rankings, CRA made
the arbitrary decision to place Pennsylvania in the second tier of
schools. </p>
<p>All tables with rankings: Statistics sometimes are given according
to departmental rank. Schools are ranked only if they offer a CS degree
and according to the quality of their CS program as determined by
reputation. Those that only offer CE degrees are not ranked, and
statistics are given on a separate line, apart from the rankings. </p>
<p>All ethnicity tables: Ethnic breakdowns are drawn from guidelines
set forth by the U.S. Department of Education. </p>
<p>All faculty tables: The survey makes no distinction between faculty
specializing in CS vs. CE programs. Every effort is made to minimize
the inclusion of faculty in electrical engineering who are not computer
engineers.</p>
