<p><font face="Verdana" size="5">Survey Results Show Better Balance in
Supply
and Demand</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>By Moshe Y. Vardi, Tim Finin, and
Tom
Henderson</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This article and the accompanying
figures and
tables present the results of the 32nd annual CRA Taulbee Survey1 of
Ph.D.-granting departments of computer science (CS) and computer
engineering
(CE) in the United States and Canada. This survey is conducted annually
by the
Computing Research Association to document trends in student
enrollment,
employment of graduates, and faculty salaries.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Information is gathered during the
fall and
early winter. The period the data cover varies from table to table.
Degree
production (Ph.D., Master's, and Bachelor's) and total Bachelor's,
Master's and Ph.D. enrollments refer to the previous academic year
(2001-2002). Data for new students in all
categories refer to
the current academic year (2002-2003). Projected student production and
information on faculty salaries and demographics also refer to the
current
academic year. Faculty salaries are those effective January 1, 2003.
Responses
received by January 3, 2003 are included in the analysis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The data were collected from
Ph.D.-granting
departments only. A total of 225 departments were surveyed, compared
with 215
departments last year. As shown in Figure 1, 182 departments returned
their
survey forms, for a response rate of 80 percent (the same as last
year). The
return rate of 10 out of 28 (36%) for Computer Engineering (CE)
programs is very
low, as has been the case for several years (see below). We attribute
this low
response to two factors: 1) many CE programs are part of an ECE
department, and
they do not keep separate statistics for CE vs. EE; and 2) many of
these
departments are not aware of the Taulbee Survey or its importance. The
response
rate for US CS departments (150 of 170, or 88%) was very good, as was
the 82%
response rate for Canadian programs. We thank all respondents who
completed this
year's questionnaire. Departments that participated are listed at the
end of
this article.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The set of departments responding is
somewhat
different each year (10 more departments responded this year); thus, we
must
approach any trend analysis with caution. Due to the low return rate
for CE
departments, the same caveat applies to the CE data. In our discussion,
we will
focus on the combined numbers for CS and CE. Because of the low return
rate for
CE, the CRA board has decided to combine the CS and CE data in future
Taulbee
Surveys and not offer separate data for CE.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For more details on how the faculty
salary
information (Tables 27-34) is to be interpreted, see the article in the
January
2003 CRN on Preliminary Taulbee Faculty Salary Data (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/jan03/vardi.finin.henderson.html">/CRN/articles/jan03/vardi.finin.henderson.html</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The survey form itself is modified
slightly
each year to ensure a high rate of return (e.g., by simplifying and
clarifying),
while continuing to capture the data necessary to understand trends in
the
discipline and also reflect changing concerns of the computing research
community. In previous years, <a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables27to34.html">
Tables 27-34</a> have only reported the mean salaries.
We believe, however, that for aggregating data the median is more
meaningful
than the mean, since it is less skewed by outlying data points. This
year we
have included both mean and median salaries to facilitate comparison
with
previous Taulbee Surveys. In future surveys, however, we intend to
report only
median salaries. Departments will be asked to provide only the minimum,
median,
and maximum salaries.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Ph.D. Degree Production and
Enrollments (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables1to8.html">Tables
1-8</a>)</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As shown in <a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables1to8.html"> Table
1</a>, a total of 849 Ph.D.
degrees were awarded in 2002 by the 182 responding departments. As
Figure 2
indicates, this is the lowest number since 1989. Most likely this
number is
still reflecting the high-tech boom of the late 1990s, when start-up
companies
presented an extremely attractive employment option for computer
scientists.</font></p>
<p><img src="taulbe6.gif" border="1" height="286" width="671"></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The prediction from last year's survey
that
1,205 Ph.D. degrees would be awarded in 2002 was, as usual, overly
optimistic,
with an "optimism" ratio, defined as the actual over the predicted,
being 0.70. Given next year's prediction of 1,224 graduates (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables1to8.html">Table
1</a>), we
predict the actual number will be between 850 and 950.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All other numbers indicate a strong
growth in
the Ph.D. supply in the next few years. The number entering Ph.D.
programs (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables1to8.html#5">Table
5</a>) increased from 2,702 to 3,286 (22%). The number who passed
qualifiers (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables1to8.html">Table
1</a>) increased from 1,244 to 1,375 (11%), but the number who passed
thesis
proposal exams (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables1to8.html">Table
1</a>) decreased slightly from 917 to 884 (-4.0%). Total Ph.D.
enrollment (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables1to8.html#6">Table
6</a>) increased from 8,810 to 10,021 (14%). Looking beyond our
survey results, some CS programs are reporting record numbers of
applicants to
their Ph.D. programs this year. It seems that the failure of the
dot-com boom
has convinced many recent Bachelor's and Master's degree recipients to
return to
graduate school.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables1to8.html#4">Table
4</a> shows area of specialization versus
types of first appointments for Ph.D. recipients in 2002. The table
shows a
marked shift from industrial to academic employment. More than 52% of
fresh
Ph.D.s found academic employment (43% last year) and only 38.2% found
industrial
employment (49% last year). There has also been a non-negligible
increase in the
number of postdoctoral positions (from 56 to 83).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most statistics on gender and
ethnicity for
Ph.D. students (Tables <a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables1to8.html#2">2</a>,
<a href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables1to8.html#3">3</a>,
<a href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables1to8.html#7">7</a>,
<a href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables1to8.html#8">8</a>)
show remarkably little change from last year.
White and nonresident-alien men continue to account for a very large
fraction of
our Ph.D. production and enrollments. Women constitute a significant
minority
(19% of enrollments, 18% of graduates.) All other underrepresented
groups are
very small minorities. As Figure 3 illustrates, we see a slight
decrease in the
proportion of enrolled Ph.D. students who are nonresident aliens,
probably
reflecting an increased interest in Ph.D. programs by U.S. students.</font></p>
<p><img src="taulbe7.gif" border="1" height="261" width="671"></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Master's and Bachelor's Degree
Production
and Enrollments (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables9to16.html">Tables
9-16</a>)</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The statistics on Master's and
Bachelor's
programs show mixed trends. Master's degrees were awarded to 7,918
students, a
decrease of 4 percent from last year. Bachelor's degrees numbered
20,677, an
increase of 21 percent. This year's Master's production exceeded the
projection
from last year's survey by 8 percent, while Bachelor's production
exceeded
projections by 11 percent.</font></p>
<p><img src="taulbe8.gif" border="1" height="299" width="671"></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The number of new undergraduates
actually
dropped slightly from 23,090 to 23,033 (0%) (see Figure 5), in contrast
with
significant increases in recent years. As yet, we cannot determine
whether this
was simply an artifact of the changes in the departments reporting, or
the start
of a new trend. Perhaps the decline in the technology industry is
making
computer science and engineering less alluring to new undergraduates.
In
addition, some programs may be operating in "saturation" mode, where
they simply cannot accept more undergraduate majors, given their
teaching
resources. It is quite clear that the period of explosive growth in
enrollments
in Bachelor's programs is over. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the
trend of
increasing enrollments is near its peak, and is perhaps headed towards
a
decline.</font></p>
<p><img src="taulbe9.gif" border="1" height="305" width="671"></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In all other numbers, we again see
mixed trends
in both Bachelor's and Master's programs. New Master's students (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables9to16.html#13">Table
13</a>)
decreased by 3% percent; total enrollments in Bachelor's programs (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables9to16.html#16">Table
16</a>)
increased by 11% and enrollments in Master's programs (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables9to16.html#15">Table
15</a>) increased by
21%. We seem to be in a period of changing patterns in all degree
programs; it
may take a while before the new trends are clear.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most demographics regarding gender and
ethnicity for Bachelor's and Master's students show remarkable
stability when
compared with last year's results. As with Ph.D. recipients (whose
numbers
actually decreased this year), the proportion of Master's degree
recipients who
are nonresident aliens decreased slightly, from 57 percent last year to
56
percent this year (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables9to16.html#10">Table
10</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Faculty Demographics (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables17to23.html">Tables
17-23</a>)</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Over the past year, the total number
of faculty
increased by 3 percent to a total of 5,520. This increase was present
in all
faculty categories (but not for researchers or postdocs). Considering
that 229
faculty are reported to have left their current positions in academia (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables17to23.html#23">Table
23</a>), the survey indicates 405 new faculty positions this year. Our
Ph.D.
production shows only 351 graduates taking faculty positions (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables1to8.html#4">Table
4</a>). Some of
the new teaching faculty may not have Ph.D. degrees, and some new
faculty may
have come from nonacademic sources. There is some influx of existing
Ph.D.-holders into academia as industrial labs are being downsized and
reorganized.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This year's faculty growth to 5,520
was less
than the prediction of 5,955 from last year's survey. The planned
two-year
growth rate of 14 percent is significantly less than last year's 21
percent. The
projected target of 5,881 positions for 2003-04 reflects growth of less
than 7
percent. Last year we observed that the planned growth targets were
unrealistically aggressive, compared with the predicted supply of new
Ph.D.s.
This year, the combination of increasing supply (because of the
increased
attractiveness of academia) and decreasing targets makes the recruiting
objectives seem more feasible, although the tough economic environment
suggests
that even 7% growth is perhaps too optimistic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables17to23.html#23">Table
23</a> on faculty "losses" shows
that a large number took academic positions elsewhere. Only 89 (1.6% of
total
faculty) actually left academia through death, retirement, or taking
nonacademic
positions. This compares with 140 (2.6% of total faculty) last year.
Overall,
the rate of departures over the past few years has remained within the
very
stable range of between 1.6 percent and 2.6 percent. The faculty
"retention
problem" that was so much discussed over the past few years seems to
have
solved itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The demographic data for faculty (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables17to23.html#19">Tables
19-22</a>)
are very similar to those from last year. We see that the gender split
of new
faculty (82% male, 18% female) is very close to the split for new Ph.D.
recipients (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables1to8.html#2">Table
2</a>). There is some skew in the distribution, with somewhat more
men in tenure-track (83%) and research (89%) positions, and somewhat
more women
in teaching (26%) and other (60%) positions, but these numbers are
actually more
balanced than in previous years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is interesting to compare the
ethnicity data
for new faculty (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables17to23.html#20">Table
20</a>) with that of Ph.D. recipients (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables1to8.html#3">Table
3</a>). Fully 55
percent of the new faculty are white, non-Hispanic, even though only 37
percent
of the Ph.D. recipients are in this category. By contrast, only 23
percent of
the new faculty are nonresident aliens, whereas fully 47 percent of the
degree
recipients are in that category. Some new faculty could have become
residents
after receiving their Ph.D. degrees, but it seems clear that
proportionately
fewer foreign students take positions at U.S. universities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Research Expenditures and Graduate
Student
Support (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables24to26.html">Tables
24-26</a>)</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first question asked: "For the
most
recently completed fiscal year, what was the department's total
expenditure
(including indirect costs or "overhead" as stated on project budgets)
from external sources of support for Computer Science/Engineering
research?" The results are reported in <a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables24to26.html">Table
24</a>, showing both absolute and
per-capita numbers, where capitation is computed relative to the number
of
tenured and tenure-track faculty members. Canadian levels are shown in
Canadian
dollars. The data show a clear correlation between ranking and
per-capita
expenditures, although this correlation holds only between ranking
bands (1-12,
13-24, etc.) and per-capita expenditures. As expected, Canadian
departments show
a lower level of expenditures from external sources, stemming, no
doubt, from
the different way that research is funded in Canada. Computer
engineering
departments also show a lower level of expenditures from external
sources, but
no conclusion can be drawn due to the low response rate of computer
engineering
departments.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The second question asked departments
to
"provide the number of graduate students supported as full-time
students as
of fall 2002," further categorized as teaching assistants, research
assistants, fellows, or computer systems' supporters, and split between
those on
institutional vs. external funds. The results are shown in <a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables24to26.html#25">
Table
25</a>. Overall, we
can see that the higher-ranked schools are able to support more
students with
research positions through research assistantships and fellowships,
while the
other schools rely more on teaching assistantships to support their
students.
Canadian schools also have a high proportion (52%) of students
supported via
teaching assistantships. The number supported for computer systems
support is
very small.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The third question asked respondents
to
"provide the net amount (as of fall 2002) of an academic-year stipend
for a
graduate student (not including tuition or fees)." The results are
shown in
<a href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables24to26.html#26">Table
26</a>. Canadian stipends are shown in Canadian dollars. The numbers
suggest a
gap between departments in the top two ranking bands and departments in
lower
bands in all categories of graduate-student support.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Faculty Salaries (<a
 href="/CRN/articles/march03/tables27to34.html">Tables
27-34</a>)</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">U.S. average salaries increased by
just over 3
percent for different categories, less than last year's increases
(average
salaries for non-teaching faculty actually declined slightly). Canadian
salaries
(shown as 12-month salaries in Canadian dollars) increased by 3.8% to
5.2% for
different categories, less than for last year (again with a slight

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Concluding Observations</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Overall, signs indicate a continued
growth in
graduate (both Master's and Ph.D.) programs in computer science and
engineering.
Although Ph.D. output declined slightly this year, it appears there
will be a
significant increase over the next few years. The growth at the
Bachelor's level
has diminished compared with recent years, with even a slight decrease
in the
number of newly declared majors. It is still too early to tell whether
this is
the start of a trend toward declining undergraduate enrollments (as has
happened
at other times during downturns in the technology economy), whether it
simply
indicates that many programs are operating at full capacity and cannot
expand
further, or whether it is just an artifact of the shifting departments
responding to our survey. We suspect, however, that this is the start
of a trend
toward declining enrollments.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">1. The title of the survey honors
the late Orrin E. Taulbee of the University of Pittsburgh, who
conducted these surveys for the Computer Science Board until 1984, with
retrospective annual data going back to 1970.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2. Although the University of
Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago were tied in the National
Research Council rankings, CRA made the arbitrary decision to place
Pennsylvania in the second tier of schools.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All tables with rankings: Statistics
sometimes are given according to departmental rank. Schools are ranked
only if they offer a CS degree and according to the quality of their CS
program as determined by reputation. Those that only offer CE degrees
are not ranked, and statistics are given on a separate line, apart from
the rankings.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All ethnicity tables: Ethnic
breakdowns are drawn from guidelines set forth by the U.S. Department
of Education.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All faculty tables: The survey makes
no distinction between faculty specializing in CS vs. CE programs.
Every effort is made to minimize the inclusion of faculty in electrical
engineering who are not computer engineers.</font></p>
