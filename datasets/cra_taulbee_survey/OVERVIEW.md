#CRA Taulbee Survey

```
The Taulbee Survey is the principal source of information on the enrollment, production, and employment of Ph.D.s in computer science and computer engineering (CS & CE) and in providing salary and demographic data for faculty in CS & CE in North America. Statistics given include gender and ethnicity breakdowns.

Conducted each fall since 1974, the survey in general covers the preceding academic year. Faculty salary data, however, are for the current year. The survey has always had an excellent response rateâ€“a fact which we believe lends great credibility to the result.

Preliminary results are made available in mid-December only to survey respondents. Respondents and CRA member departments receive the final results in mid-February.
