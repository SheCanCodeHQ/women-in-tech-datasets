<p>2003-2004 Taulbee Survey </p>
<p>Record Ph.D. Production on the Horizon; Undergraduate Enrollments Continue in 
Decline </p>
</font>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
<p><b>By Stuart Zweben </b></p>
<p>This article and the accompanying figures and tables present the results of 
the 34th annual CRA Taulbee Survey [1] of Ph.D.-granting departments of computer 
science (CS) and computer engineering (CE) in the United States and Canada. This 
survey is conducted annually by the Computing Research Association to document 
trends in student enrollment, employment of graduates, and faculty salaries. </p>
<p>The information was collected in the fall of 2004. Responses received by 
January 17, 2005 are included in the analysis. The period covered by the data 
varies from table to table. Degree production and enrollment (Ph.D., Master's, 
and Bachelor's) refer to the previous academic year (2003-04). Data for new 
students in all categories refer to the current academic year (2004-05). 
Projected student production and information on faculty salaries and 
demographics also refer to the current academic year. Faculty salaries are those 
effective January 1, 2005. </p>
<p>The data were collected from Ph.D.-granting departments only. A total of 229 
departments were surveyed, four more than last year. As shown in Figure 1, 189 
departments submitted their survey forms, for a response rate of 83% (the 
highest in the past ten years). The return rate of 10 out of 30 (33%) for 
Computer Engineering (CE) programs is very low, as has been customary. Many CE 
programs are part of an ECE department, and they do not keep separate statistics 
for CE vs. EE. In addition, many of these departments are unaware of the Taulbee 
Survey or its importance. The response rate for US CS departments (158 of 172, 
or 92%) was very good, while the 78% response rate for Canadian programs was 
moderately good.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="taulbe1.gif"></p>
<p>The set of departments responding varies slightly from year to year, even 
when the total numbers are about the same; thus, we must approach any trend 
analysis with caution. We must be especially cautious in using the data about CE 
departments because of the low response rate. However, we have reported CE 
departments separately because there are some significant differences between CS 
and CE departments. </p>
<p>The survey form itself is modified slightly each year to ensure a high rate 
of return (e.g., by simplifying and clarifying), while continuing to capture the 
data necessary to understand trends in the discipline and also reflect the 
changing concerns of the computing research community. In December 2004, 
preliminary survey results about faculty salaries were provided to departments 
that had responded. The CRA Board views this as a benefit of participating in 
the survey. This practice began last year and is expected to continue. </p>
<p>We thank all respondents who completed this year's questionnaire. The names 
of the departments that participated are listed at the end of this article. </p>
<p><b><a name="1"></a>Ph.D. Degree Production and Enrollments (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.1to8">Tables 1-8</a>) </b></p>
<p>As shown in <a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.1to8">Table 1</a>, a total of 1,032 Ph.D. degrees were awarded in 2004 
	by the 189 responding departments. This is an increase of more than 17% over 
	last year, and represents the highest number of Ph.D.s produced in almost a 
	decade. In previous Taulbee reports, we foresaw a large increase in Ph.D. 
	production based on the growing number of students passing qualifier exams. 
	It appears that this was the year the significantly increased degree 
	production really materialized, even allowing for the increased number of 
	departments reporting. </p>
<p>As in previous years, the prediction from last year's survey that 1,350 
	Ph.D. degrees would be awarded in 2004 was overly optimistic. The “optimism 
	ratio,” defined as the actual over the predicted, was 0.76, a slight 
	increase over last year. Based on previous experiences, next year's 
	prediction of 1,480 graduates (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.1to8">Table 1</a>) is likely to yield an actual 
	production in the 1,100 range, and production may exceed the 1992 all-time 
	annual Taulbee Survey record of 1,113 (see Figure 2).</p>
<p><img border="0" src="taulbe2.gif"></p>
<p>The number entering Ph.D. programs (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.1to8">Table 5</a>) decreased from 3,131 to 
	2,887 (8%), following a 5% decrease last year. This year, the decrease is 
	entirely in the U.S. programs, which exhibited no change in the size of the 
	entering class last year. Canadian departments actually reported a 20% 
	increase in new Ph.D. students after a drop last year, though Canadian 
	numbers are more greatly affected by the specific departments responding to 
	the survey than are the U.S. CS numbers. There were reports of a large drop 
	in applications from international students last year, and this apparently 
	also affected eventual admissions to the graduate programs. However, the 
	number who passed qualifiers (Table 1) increased tremendously, from 1,545 to 
	2,318 (50%). On a per-department basis, the number passing qualifiers has 
	risen from 6.5 to 12.3 (89%) in four years. The number who passed thesis 
	proposal exams (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.1to8">Table 1</a>) rose 16% this year to 1,025 after being flat last 
	year. Total Ph.D. enrollment (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.1to8">Table 6</a>) increased from 12,007 to 14,234 
	(19%), on the heels of a similar (20%) increase last year. While there are 
	fewer new students entering the programs, those who are entering appear to 
	be staying in much larger numbers than was the case several years ago. 
	Economic conditions no doubt have a lot to do with this. </p>
<p>Figure 3 shows a longer-term trend of the number of CS Ph.D. graduates, 
	normalized by the number of departments reporting to the Taulbee Survey. The 
	figure also indicates the number of new students entering Ph.D. programs and 
	the number of students who passed qualifiers. These also are normalized for 
	the number of departments reporting. The graph offsets the qualifier data by 
	one year from the data for new students, and offsets the graduation data by 
	five years from the data for new students, to approximate the lag between 
	student entrance into the pipeline and the qualifier and exit timeframe for 
	the same cohort. The figure suggests that a much larger fraction of those 
	entering the program are now passing qualifiers; the most recent data look 
	more like the pre-dot-com boom years. Unless a larger fraction of those 
	passing qualifiers do not complete the program, record levels of Ph.D. 
	production can be expected soon.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="taulbe3.gif"></p>
<p><a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.1to8">Table 4</a> shows employment for new Ph.D. recipients. Of those who reported 
	employment domestically, 60% took academic employment (compared to 63% last 
	year and 53% the year before). Most of these academic positions were in 
	Ph.D.-granting departments, but a smaller percentage went into tenure-track 
	positions (27.5% vs. 34.2% last year). Only 31 were in other CS/CE 
	departments. This is identical to the number reported last year as having 
	gone to non-Ph.D.-granting CS/CE departments. It still appears quite low 
	relative to meeting the needs of those departments. There was a considerable 
	increase (from 89 to 122) in the number of postdoctoral positions taken by 
	new Ph.D.s (up from 56 three years ago), although the total number of 
	postdocs in the academic departments (295, see 
	<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.17to23">Table 17</a>) actually fell 
	slightly (from 312 last year). Figure 4 shows the trend of employment of new 
	Ph.D.s to academia and industry, and the proportion of those going to 
	academia who took positions other than in Ph.D-granting CS/CE departments. 
	The trend in favor of academic jobs during the most recent three years is in 
	sharp contrast to that of the dot-com boom years, though this year there was 
	a slight narrowing of the gap.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="taulbe4.gif"></p>
<p>The proportion (4.5%) of Ph.D. graduates who were reported as having 
	taken positions abroad, among those whose employment is known, is similar to 
	that of the previous three years (4.1, 4.5, and 4.1%, respectively). Unless 
	there really is a change hidden in the much larger number of those in the 
	“employment unknown” category (206 this year vs. 126 last year), this lack 
	of a trend may surprise those who feel that the offshoring of jobs is taking 
	many more graduates of our Ph.D. programs away from North America. </p>
<p>The data in <a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.1to8">Table 4</a> also indicate increases over last year in the 
	proportion of new CS/CE Ph.D.s in the AI/robotics, OS/networks, and software 
	engineering areas, while the programming languages/compilers, 
	theory/algorithms, numerical analysis/scientific computing, and 
	database/information systems areas each experienced a decreased proportion 
	of Ph.D.s. Multi-year trends are less clear, with only the graphics/HCI area 
	showing any reasonably consistent trend (increasing) during the past five 
	years. </p>
<p>Most statistics on gender and ethnicity for Ph.D. students (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.1to8">Tables 2, 3, 
	7, 8</a>) again show little change from the last several years. White and 
	nonresident-alien men continue to account for a very large fraction of our 
	Ph.D. production and enrollments. The proportion of female Ph.D. graduates 
	(18.0%) is up from the 16.5% figure last year. However, with women 
	representing only about 20% of the overall Ph.D. enrollments, the proportion 
	of female graduates is unlikely to climb considerably in the near future. 
	All other underrepresented groups are very small minorities. The proportion 
	of enrolled Ph.D. students who are nonresident aliens (more than 50%) is 
	similar to last year. Thus, the reported decreases in Ph.D. applications 
	from abroad and the decline in the total number of new Ph.D. students does 
	not seem to have affected the overall demographics of the Ph.D. programs, at 
	least not yet. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="taulbe5.gif"></p>
<p><b><a name="9"></a>Master's and Bachelor's Degree Production and Enrollments (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.9to16">Tables 9-16</a>)
</b></p>
<p>The statistics on Master's and Bachelor's degrees awarded show mixed 
	trends. Master's degrees were awarded to 9,879 students, an increase of 8% 
	(following an increase of 15% the previous year). As was noted last year, 
	this increase may be a byproduct of the increased enrollment trends in Ph.D. 
	programs, since in many schools students obtain the M.S. on the way to the 
	Ph.D. No doubt it is influenced also by the increase of 6% in the number of 
	departments reporting this year. Actual masters degrees awarded exceeded 
	last year’s projections by 21%. This year's expected Master's production 
	(<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.9to16">Table 12</a>) exceeds the projection from last year's survey by 4%, but this 
	also happened last year. In any case, next year’s production level may well 
	exceed 10,000. </p>
<p>Bachelor's degrees numbered 20,971 (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.9to16">Table 9</a>), a 5% increase over last 
	year (following a 3% decrease the year before). There still appears to be 
	residual influence of the high level of undergraduate program enrollment 
	that began in the late 1990s and remained strong until the early 2000s. 
	There also is the effect of the larger number of programs reporting this 
	year. On a per-department basis, the number of Bachelor’s graduates is about 
	the same as last year. Actual Bachelor’s production in departments reporting 
	this year exceeded the projection from last year’s reporting departments by 
	11%. Projected Bachelor's production for this year shows a decrease from 
	this year’s actuals of 6%, but this represents an increase over last year’s 
	projections of 5%, probably again due in large part to the increased number 
	of departments reporting (see Figure 6). </p>
<p><img border="0" src="taulbe6.gif"></p>
<p>The number of new undergraduate majors dropped 10%, from 17,706 to 
	15,950, (see Figure 7). This follows last year’s 23% drop in new majors. The 
	number of pre-majors in both computer science and computer engineering also 
	is down considerably from last year (20% in CS and 17% in CE) so we likely 
	have not yet seen the end of the decreased undergraduate enrollments. Also 
	note that the larger number of departments reporting this year softens the 
	impact on the totals, so the percentage declines in new majors and 
	pre-majors likely are even greater. As 
	<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.9to16">Table 14</a> shows, per-department 
	numbers are holding steady in CS departments ranked 1-12, but are down for 
	all others. This trend has been reported extensively in the media during the 
	past year.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="taulbe7.gif"></p>
<p>New Master's students (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.9to16">Table 13</a>) decreased by 17% after having decreased 
	by 8% last year. This continues, and accelerates the trend from the dot-com 
	crash, as fewer students seek degree programs designed mainly to prepare 
	them for industry employment. Total enrollment in Bachelor's programs (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.9to16">Table 
	16</a>) is approximately the same as it was last year (having dropped last year 
	by 19% from the previous year). However, the U.S. CS total enrollment is 
	down by 7%; this represents an increased number of reporting departments, so 
	the downward trend appears to be continuing, as one might predict from the 
	new student enrollment trends. Total enrollments in Master's programs (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.9to16">Table 
	15</a>) increased by about 3% (having dropped by 4% last year), but the larger 
	number of departments reporting probably counters this increase in numbers.
	</p>
<p>Most demographics regarding gender and ethnicity for Bachelor's and 
	Master's students continue to be similar to those of previous years. The 
	proportion of Master's degree recipients who are nonresident aliens (50.6%) 
	is down from 55.8% the previous year, while there are slight gains in the 
	fractions of White, non-Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islanders (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.9to16">Table 10</a>). 
</p>
<p><b><a name="17"></a>Faculty Demographics (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.17to23">Tables 17-23</a>) </b></p>
<p>Over the past year, the total number of faculty increased by only 1.5% to 
	a total of 5,919. Increases of 4% in tenure-track faculty and 5% in teaching 
	faculty were offset by decreases in other categories, and also should be 
	viewed in terms of the increased number of departments reporting this year.
	</p>
<p>Ph.D. production shows 461 graduates known to have taken faculty 
	positions at CS/CE Ph.D-granting departments (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.1to8">Table 4</a>).
	<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.17to23">Tables 19 and 20</a> 
	indicate that a total of 608 persons were hired during the past year. Thus, 
	more than 75% of the faculty hires made this past year by Ph.D.-granting 
	CS/CE departments appear to have been new Ph.D.s, with the rest consisting 
	of a combination of faculty who changed academic positions, persons joining 
	academia from government and industry, new Ph.D.s from outside of North 
	America and from disciplines outside of CS/CE, and non-Ph.D. holders (e.g., 
	taking a teaching faculty appointment). The fraction of tenure-track hires 
	who were new Ph.D.s appears to be more than 80% (227 new Ph.D.s taking 
	tenure-track faculty positions at Ph.D.-granting programs, and 279 new 
	tenure-track faculty hired by these programs). </p>
<p>This year's total faculty size of 5,919 is very close to the prediction 
	of 5,928 from last year's survey. This is the second year in a row that 
	departments collectively did a good job predicting their faculty growth. 
	Planned growth for this year is 6% and an additional 5% is predicted for the 
	following year. This apparent increased opportunity for faculty jobs over 
	the past year is good news for the larger number of Ph.D.s we are producing.
	</p>
<p><a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.17to23">Table 23</a> on faculty “losses” shows that only 75 people (which is less 
	than 2% of all faculty) actually left academia this past year through death, 
	retirement, or taking nonacademic positions. The amount of “churn,” the 
	number of professors moving from one academic position to another, went from 
	74 to 87. This reflects an increase over last year, even after accounting 
	for the number of departments reporting, but is 20% less than that observed 
	just two years ago. </p>
<p>The percentage of newly hired women faculty dropped from 19% to 17%. The 
	gender split of new faculty (83% male, 17% female) again is close to the 
	split for new Ph.D. recipients (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.1to8">Table 2</a>). The percentage of newly hired 
	postdoctoral students who are women decreased from 21% last year to only 15% 
	this year. </p>
<p>In examining the ethnicity data for new faculty (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.17to23">Table 20</a>), we note that 
	the percentage of newly hired tenure-track faculty who are Asian/Pacific 
	Islanders increased slightly. The fraction of new postdocs who were 
	nonresident aliens increased from 33% to 45%. The fraction of new teaching 
	faculty who were nonresident aliens decreased, while the fraction who were 
	White, non-Hispanic increased. </p>
<p>As we observed last year, it appears that once again disproportionately 
	fewer foreign students are being hired into faculty positions at North 
	American universities. Approximately 49% of the newly hired tenure-track 
	faculty in PhD-granting departments and 78% of the newly hired teaching 
	faculty are White, non-Hispanic, even though only 35% of the Ph.D. 
	recipients are in this category (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.1to8">Table 3</a>). In contrast, only 27% of the new 
	faculty (all employment categories combined, where ethnicity is known) are 
	nonresident aliens, while 48% of the degree recipients are in that category.

<p><b><a name="24"></a>Research Expenditures and Graduate Student Support (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.24to26">Tables 24-26</a>) </b></p>
<p><a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.24to26">Table 24-1</a> shows the department's total expenditure (including indirect 
	costs or &quot;overhead&quot; as stated on project budgets) from external sources of 
	support. <a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.24to26">Table 24-2</a> shows the per capita expenditure, where capitation is 
	computed two ways. The first is relative to the number of tenured and 
	tenure-track faculty members, which also was the method used in previous 
	years. The second is relative to researchers and postdocs, as well as 
	tenured and tenure-track faculty. As is typical, the higher the ranking, the 
	more external funding the department receives (both in total and per 
	capita). Canadian levels are shown in Canadian dollars. </p>
<p>The median per capita amount of support compared to the median reported 
	in last year’s survey varied widely (here we only compare relative to the 
	first capitation method, since only that method was used last year). In 
	ranks 1-12 and 25-36 there was double-digit growth, while in ranks 13-24 and 
	greater than 36 there actually was a decline in the medians. The 3.6% 
	decline among those ranked higher than 36 may be attributable to the larger 
	number of departments reporting this year. In ranking stratum 13-24, the 
	median total expenditure actually rose 9.5%, though the minimum and maximum 
	values both declined. </p>
<p>Canadian departments show an increase of 12% over last year in median per 
	capita expenditure, but the funding model in Canada results in a lower level 
	of expenditures from external sources than every US ranking band. It is 
	difficult to draw meaning for the numbers for computer engineering because 
	of the small number of departments reporting; the median per capita 
	expenditure for computer engineering departments rose 78% but the median 
	total expenditure declined. </p>
<p><a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.24to26">Table 25</a> shows the number of doctoral students supported as full-time 
	students as of fall 2004, further categorized as teaching assistants, 
	research assistants, fellows, or computer systems supporters, and split 
	between those on institutional vs. external funds. Departments ranked 25-36 
	showed a decline (17%) in the number of teaching assistants. Other U.S. 
	ranking strata showed increases in teaching assistants. </p>
<p>Respondents were asked to &quot;provide the net amount (as of fall 2004) of an 
	academic-year stipend for a first-year doctoral student (not including 
	tuition or fees).&quot; The results are shown in 
	<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.24to26">Table 26</a>. Canadian stipends are 
	shown in Canadian dollars. As was reported last year, the higher the ranking 
	band, the higher the median level of support for teaching assistants. Median 
	amounts of support for research assistants at the top 24 schools also are 
	much higher than those for the lower-ranked bands. Actual stipend levels at 
	U.S. departments showed no noticeable pattern this year. Some median values 
	increased while others decreased. Maximum values went down considerably in 
	some strata; it appears that special assistantships or incentives are less 
	prevalent than in previous years, as was suggested by the more extensive 
	‘Profiles’ data collected in last year’s survey. </p>
<p><b><a name="27"></a>Faculty Salaries (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.27to34">Tables 27-34</a>) </b></p>
<p>Each department was asked to report individual (but anonymous) faculty 
	salaries if possible; otherwise, the department was requested to provide the 
	minimum, median, mean, and maximum salaries for each rank (full, associate, 
	and assistant professors and non-tenure-track teaching faculty) and the 
	number of persons at each rank. The salaries are those in effect on January 
	1, 2005. For U.S. departments, nine-month salaries are reported in U.S. 
	dollars. For Canadian departments, twelve-month salaries are reported in 
	Canadian dollars. Respondents were asked to include salary supplements, such 
	as salary monies from endowed positions. </p>
<p>Here we report tables comparable to those used in previous Taulbee 
	surveys. The tables contain data about ranges and measures of central 
	tendency only. Departments that reported individual salaries were provided 
	more comprehensive distributional information in December 2004. A total of 
	147 departments (78% of those responding to the survey) provided salaries at 
	the individual level. </p>
<p>The minimum and maximum of the reported salary minima (and maxima) are 
	self-explanatory. The range of salaries in a given rank among departments 
	that reported data for that rank is the interval [&quot;minimum of the minima,&quot; 
	&quot;maximum of the maxima&quot;]. The mean of the reported salary minima (maxima) in 
	a given rank is computed by summing the departmental reported minimum 
	(maximum) and dividing by the number of departments reporting data at that 
	rank. </p>
<p>The median salary at each rank is the middle of the list if you order its 
	members’ mean salaries at that rank from lowest to highest, or the average 
	of the middle two numbers if there is an even number of items in the set. 
	The average salary at each rank is computed by summing the individual means 
	reported at each rank and dividing by the number of departments reporting at 
	that rank. We recognize that these means and medians are only approximations 
	to the true means and medians for their rank. </p>
<p>U.S. average salaries increased between 2.5% and 3.3%, depending on 
	tenure-track rank, and 4.0% for non-tenure-track teaching faculty. These 
	increases are higher than the 1.9% to 2.5% levels experienced last year for 
	tenure-track faculty and the 1.4% level for non-tenure-track teaching 
	faculty. Top-ranked departments were more likely to give larger increases to 
	senior faculty this past year, while departments ranked 25 and higher were 
	more likely to favor junior faculty. Canadian salaries (shown as 12-month 
	salaries in Canadian dollars) were 8% to 9% higher than last year, after 
	showing a slight drop last year. The Canadian figures are influenced much 
	more by the specific departments reporting in a given year than are the U.S. 
	figures. </p>
<p>Median salaries for new Ph.D.s (those who received their Ph.D. last year 
	and then joined departments as tenure-track faculty) increased 1.7% from 
	those reported in last year’s survey (<a href="/CRN/articles/may05/taulbee.27to34">Table 34</a>). This small increase follows 
	a year when the median was unchanged, giving departments two consecutive 
	years with some opportunity to adjust salaries of continuing faculty in 
	order to reduce compression and inversion problems. </p>
<p><b>Concluding Observations </b></p>
<p>For the second straight year, we see significant reductions in average 
	enrollments in the computer science major among U.S. departments. 
	Particularly noticeable is the continued drop in new majors. This trend is 
	observed in both the United States and Canada. While current enrollment 
	levels still are higher than before the dot-com boom years, the decreased 
	number of pre-majors in those departments that report pre-majors suggests 
	that we still have not bottomed out in the current decline of majors. </p>
<p>While undergraduate enrollment is in decline, Ph.D. production is 
	approaching an all-time high. With an improved economy and the drop in 
	undergraduate enrollments, there should be an increase in the fraction of 
	new Ph.D.s going to industry, but it is not clear how easily the large 
	number of new Ph.D.s will be absorbed into the new economic environment. For 
	example, we have not yet seen any trend toward new Ph.D.s going abroad. </p>
<p>Our field has enjoyed an abundance of job opportunities awaiting 
	graduates of its academic programs in most years. The trends observed in 
	this survey reflect student reactions to the job environment observed during 
	the past two to three years. Academic departments are managing in a much 
	different environment than just a few years ago. At the same time, the field 
	as a whole is trying to understand the longer-term effect of this change in 
	meeting the needs of industry, needs that also are changing in the wake of 
	the dot-com crash and the increasing use of outsourcing, both on-shore and 
	off-shore.</p>

<ol>
	<li>The title of the survey honors the late Orrin E. Taulbee of the 
		University of Pittsburgh, who conducted these surveys for the Computer 
		Science Board until 1984, with retrospective annual data going back to 
		1970. </li>
	<li>Although the University of Pennsylvania and the University of 
		Chicago were tied in the National Research Council rankings, CRA made 
		the arbitrary decision to place Pennsylvania in the second tier of 
		schools. </li>
</ol>
<p>All tables with rankings: Statistics sometimes are given according to 
	departmental rank. Schools are ranked only if they offer a CS degree and 
	according to the quality of their CS program as determined by reputation. 
	Those that only offer CE degrees are not ranked, and statistics are given on 
	a separate line, apart from the rankings. </p>
<p>All ethnicity tables: Ethnic breakdowns are drawn from guidelines set 
	forth by the U.S. Department of Education. </p>
<p>All faculty tables: The survey makes no distinction between faculty 
	specializing in CS vs. CE programs. Every effort is made to minimize the 
	inclusion of faculty in electrical engineering who are not computer 
	engineers.</p>
